## Project Overview
The **Weather Data Prediction** project is designed to forecast future weather conditions based on historical weather data. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, and model evaluation to build accurate predictive models.

## Features
- Clean and preprocess raw weather data for analysis.
- Perform feature selection to improve model performance.
- Implement machine learning models including:
  - **Ridge Regression**
  - **XGBoost**
- Evaluate model accuracy and reliability.
- Visualize weather trends and predictions.

## Key Skills / Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Concepts:** Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning, Model Evaluation, Data Visualization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
    git clone https://github.com/kavyanjali-kodali/Weather-Data-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
    cd Weather-Data-prediction
3. Install the required Python packages:  
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Weather_Prediction.ipynb`.
2. Load the dataset and run the preprocessing steps.
3. Train and evaluate the models (Ridge Regression and XGBoost).
4. Visualize the results using the provided plots.

## Project Outcomes
- Achieved high prediction accuracy for weather patterns.
- Demonstrated ability to handle real-world datasets and perform end-to-end data analysis.
- Built strong foundations in machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
